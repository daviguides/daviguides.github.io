      <h3>Description:</h3>
      <p>In the Vflow project, I played an integral role in the development of a media and streaming platform. While I
        did not lead the system's architecture, I had the opportunity to contribute to its design and gained valuable
        insights into this critical aspect of software development.</p>
      
      <p>As part of the team, I was responsible for the development, maintenance, and continuous improvement of the platform. Working on both the backend and frontend, I utilized my skills in Python, Django, JavaScript, and HTML to create efficient functionalities and an enhanced user experience.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, I acquired proficiency in SQL and Shell Scripting to ensure efficient data handling and automate routine tasks. Integrating RabbitMQ enabled effective communication between different system components.</p>
      
      <p>Throughout the project, I applied Design Patterns and Test Driven Development principles to create robust and scalable code. Through the use of RESTful Web Services, I ensured platform interoperability and flexibility.</p>
      <p>My skills in Git and MySQL were instrumental in efficient version control and solid database management. Working in a Linux environment provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the operating system and its nuances.</p>
      <p>The Vflow project was a transformative opportunity that allowed me to learn and enhance my software development skills in the media and streaming domain. I am confident that the experience and knowledge gained make me a qualified and motivated professional, ready to tackle new challenges and contribute to the success of your team.

      <h2>A bit about me</h2>
      <p>I am a very curious and proactive professional with a great capacity to absorb new knowledge. I always seek
        to think creatively, practically, and systematically to achieve the most relevant results for the business. I
        always ask myself: What pain are we addressing here? How much value and differentiation will this add to the
        company? If the answer is positive, I try to understand which part of the whole will bring the greatest impact.
        Whether alone or in a group, it is a pleasure to accomplish and see things happen.</p>

      </div>


      <p>As a neurodivergent person with Giftedness, my hyperfocus and commitment are focused on continuous learning and
        improvement, respecting both my uncommon abilities, such as divergent deep thinking, whole-detail perspective,
        integration of opposing ideas and perspectives, among others, and the limitations of my condition, such as
        hyperesthesia and hypersensitivities, among others.</p>

      <p>I thrive in projects that offer constant growth opportunities and challenges, particularly those with a
        data-driven, pragmatic, ethical, and pluralistic decision-making approach.</p>

      <p>Pronouns: He/Him 🌈</p>

      <p>Fun fact: I have a beautiful black cat who sometimes shows up to say hello in meetings or do some pair
        programming with me.</p>

        Other curiosities: once every 15 days, my friend Ana comes over and we do a home co-working session.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, once a month, Ana and I have a Spa Saturday, dedicated to being a day of relaxation, with meditation,
        QiGong
        and yoga practices, reiki, and more. It's important for us to reduce stress levels and keep our minds fresh and
        ready for action.
