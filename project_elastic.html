                <img src="./assets/images/elastic.jpg" />
            </div>
            <h3>Project Overview:</h3>
            <p>Our project aimed at developing a high-performance API for managing product pick-up locations for a
                leading social commerce platform in Latin America. We intended to enhance search speed and performance,
                thus enriching the end-user experience.</p>

            <h3>Challenges, Solutions & Results:</h3>
            <p>The most substantial challenge was mirroring the registration system to create a more efficient and
                performant API. By leveraging technologies such as Elasticsearch, Redis, and Python Microservices on
                K8s, we successfully designed a system that improved the search speed threefold compared to the legacy
                monolithic system.</p>

            <p>Another notable challenge was managing a fully remote team, each located in a different city. We tackled
                this by employing collaborative tools and fostering a culture of clear communication, allowing us to
                operate synergistically.</p>

            <h3>Role & Responsibilities:</h3>
            <p>As a Staff Python Backend Developer, I was at the heart of this project. My primary responsibilities
                included:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Designing the software architecture.</li>
                <li>Serving as a technical reference point for the team.</li>
                <li>Leading backend development using Python and SQL.</li>
                <li>Defining stories, conducting code reviews, and mentoring junior developers.</li>
                <li>Ensuring efficient code versioning using Git and GitHub.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Process, Teamwork & Collaboration:</h3>
            <p>We adopted the Agile/Scrum methodology, allowing for continuous iterations and improvement. We began each
                iteration with a planning session, followed by the team working on tasks and stories. Daily scrum
                meetings and sprint reviews ensured everyone stayed on track and learned from each iteration.</p>

            <p>The fully distributed nature of our team posed unique collaboration challenges. However, by establishing
                clear communication channels and utilizing collaborative tools like Jira, we were able to work
                effectively and maintain high productivity.</p>

            <h3>Deployment & Operations:</h3>
            <p>We employed a CI/CD pipeline for building and deploying the application, ensuring smooth and frequent
                releases. For containerization and orchestration, Docker and Kubernetes were used, respectively.</p>

            <h3>Learnings & Future Scope:</h3>
            <p>This project reaffirmed the value of robust software architecture and the potential of modern tech stacks
                in solving complex business problems. It also highlighted the effectiveness of well-coordinated remote
                teams and the role of clear communication. For future developments, I would remain open to new tools or
                technologies that could further optimize the system.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
            <p>This project was a great learning curve, and the role of a Staff Python Backend Developer gave me the
                opportunity to flex my problem-solving skills in a high-stakes environment. I was able to contribute
                significantly to the project's success, and the experience has reinforced my technical prowess and
                ability to lead and work collaboratively within diverse teams.</p>

            <h2>A bit about me</h2>
            <p>I am a very curious and proactive professional with a great capacity to absorb new knowledge. I always
                seek
                to think creatively, practically, and systematically to achieve the most relevant results for the
                business. I
                always ask myself: What pain are we addressing here? How much value and differentiation will this add to
                the
                company? If the answer is positive, I try to understand which part of the whole will bring the greatest
                impact.
                Whether alone or in a group, it is a pleasure to accomplish and see things happen.</p>

            <p>As a neurodivergent person with Giftedness, my hyperfocus and commitment are focused on continuous
                learning and
                improvement, respecting both my uncommon abilities, such as divergent deep thinking, whole-detail
                perspective,
                integration of opposing ideas and perspectives, among others, and the limitations of my condition, such
                as
                hyperesthesia and hypersensitivities, among others.</p>

            <p>I thrive in projects that offer constant growth opportunities and challenges, particularly those with a
                data-driven, pragmatic, ethical, and pluralistic decision-making approach.</p>

            <p>Pronouns: He/Him 🌈</p>

            <p>Fun fact: I have a beautiful black cat who sometimes shows up to say hello in meetings or do some pair
                programming with me.</p>

                Other curiosities: once every 15 days, my friend Ana comes over and we do a home co-working session.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, once a month, Ana and I have a Spa Saturday, dedicated to being a day of relaxation, with
                meditation,
                QiGong
                and yoga practices, reiki, and more. It's important for us to reduce stress levels and keep our minds
                fresh and
                ready for action.
