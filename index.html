    <h2>More About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a very curious and proactive professional with a great capacity to absorb new knowledge. I always seek
      to think creatively, practically, and systematically to achieve the most relevant results for the business. I
      always ask myself: What pain are we addressing here? How much value and differentiation will this add to the
      company? If the answer is positive, I try to understand which part of the whole will bring the greatest impact.
      Whether alone or in a group, it is a pleasure to accomplish and see things happen.</p>

    </div>


    <p>As a neurodivergent person with Giftedness, my hyperfocus and commitment are focused on continuous learning and
      improvement, respecting both my uncommon abilities, such as divergent deep thinking, whole-detail perspective,
      integration of opposing ideas and perspectives, among others, and the limitations of my condition, such as
      hyperesthesia and hypersensitivities, among others.</p>

    <p>I thrive in projects that offer constant growth opportunities and challenges, particularly those with a
      data-driven, pragmatic, ethical, and pluralistic decision-making approach.</p>

    <p>Fun fact: I have a beautiful black cat who sometimes shows up to say hello in meetings or do some pair
      programming with me.</p>

      Other curiosities: once every 15 days, my friend Ana comes over and we do a home co-working session.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, once a month, Ana and I have a Spa Saturday, dedicated to being a day of relaxation, with meditation, QiGong
      and yoga practices, reiki, and more. It's important for us to reduce stress levels and keep our minds fresh and
      ready for action.
