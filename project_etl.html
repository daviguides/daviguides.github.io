      <h2>Data Pipeline</h2>
      <p class="sumary"><em>Summary: This project saw me develop and implement an efficient ETL pipeline using Python,
          MongoDB, and MySQL.
          The experience contributed to the better handling of customer data in the debt negotiation process and
          fostered
          my growth as a backend developer.</em></p>

      <h3>Data Extraction:</h3>
      <p>Utilizing Python's Pandas library, I managed the extraction phase. I developed a robust microservice to read
        and import data from the CSV file, handling potential inconsistencies and missing values to ensure data quality.
      </p>
      <h3>Initial Data Loading:</h3>
      <p>After extraction, the data was initially loaded into MongoDB through the same microservice. This NoSQL database
        acted as a staging area, simplifying the handling of data during the transformation phase due to its flexible,
        document-oriented structure.</p>
      <h3>Data Transformation:</h3>
      <p>After loading into MongoDB, another microservice was deployed to carry out data cleaning and transformation.
        This involved normalizing and standardizing data attributes, dealing with missing data, and converting data
        types. All these processes were implemented using Python and Pandas, highlighting my skills in data cleaning,
        data preprocessing, and data wrangling.</p>
      <h3>Inter-Service Communication:</h3>
      <p>After the transformation phase, the data was then sent to a MessageQueue system. This design ensured loose
        coupling and reliable communication between different microservices, exhibiting my proficiency in asynchronous
        programming and inter-service communication.</p>
      <h3>Final Data Loading:</h3>
      <p>A separate microservice was triggered by the MessageQueue system to receive the transformed data and load it
        into the MySQL database, the final destination. The data was spread across several tables according to the
        company's core business logic, demonstrating my understanding of business logic implementation and MySQL
        database management.</p>
      <p>Throughout the project, I maintained the best practices in backend development, microservice architecture,
        MessageQueue systems, and database management. This project underscores my qualifications as a Backend Developer
        and my capability to handle complex, data-centric projects within a microservices ecosystem.</p>

      <h2>A bit about me</h2>
      <p>I am a very curious and proactive professional with a great capacity to absorb new knowledge. I always seek
        to think creatively, practically, and systematically to achieve the most relevant results for the business. I
        always ask myself: What pain are we addressing here? How much value and differentiation will this add to the
        company? If the answer is positive, I try to understand which part of the whole will bring the greatest impact.
        Whether alone or in a group, it is a pleasure to accomplish and see things happen.</p>

      <p>As a neurodivergent person with Giftedness, my hyperfocus and commitment are focused on continuous learning and
        improvement, respecting both my uncommon abilities, such as divergent deep thinking, whole-detail perspective,
        integration of opposing ideas and perspectives, among others, and the limitations of my condition, such as
        hyperesthesia and hypersensitivities, among others.</p>

      <p>I thrive in projects that offer constant growth opportunities and challenges, particularly those with a
        data-driven, pragmatic, ethical, and pluralistic decision-making approach.</p>

        programming with me.</p>

        Other curiosities: once every 15 days, my friend Ana comes over and we do a home co-working session.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, once a month, Ana and I have a Spa Saturday, dedicated to being a day of relaxation, with meditation,
        QiGong
        and yoga practices, reiki, and more. It's important for us to reduce stress levels and keep our minds fresh and
        ready for action.
