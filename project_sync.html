      <h2>Scaling Up</h2>
      <p class="sumary"><em>Summary: Amid rapid scaling challenges, we developed a project aimed at integrating a new
          pick-up point registration and management system with legacy monolithic components. By leveraging Python microservices,
          FastAPI, and cloud functions triggered via Pub/Sub, we ensured business continuity and efficiency, paving the
          way for a successful transition to an optimized microservices architecture.</em></p>

      <h3>Project Context and Overview:</h3>
      <p>In the face of a rapid scaling scenario, the company was confronted with the limitations of its MVP monolithic
        system, which could not efficiently sustain the increased load. Located within the logistics tribe, amongst six
        squads, my squad was tasked with managing all aspects of product pick-up points. The project was set against
        this backdrop, aiming to develop and integrate a new registration and management system with the remaining
        operational parts of the monolith. We employed FastAPI, Python microservices, and cloud function components
        triggered via Pub/Sub to enable this transition, highlighting a successful case of monolith-to-microservices
        migration.</p>
      <h3>Challenges, Solutions & Results:</h3>
      <p>Our primary challenge was to ensure the uninterrupted functioning of the logistics operations during the
        transition. We addressed this by developing several Python microservices and cloud function components,
        effectively ensuring a smooth synchronization between the new system and the monolithic components still in use.
        This approach guaranteed operational continuity and mitigated potential disruptions.</p>
      <h3>Role & Responsibilities:</h3>
      <p>As a Staff Python Backend Developer, my key responsibilities included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Designing the software architecture.</li>
        <li>Serving as the team's technical reference.</li>
        <li>Leading backend development using Python and SQL.</li>
        <li>Defining tasks, conducting code reviews, and mentoring junior developers.</li>
        <li>Managing repositories, branches, and pull requests.</li>
        <li>Participating in Agile/Scrum ceremonies.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Process, Teamwork & Collaboration:</h3>
      <p>Embracing Agile methodologies, our process facilitated continuous iterations and improvements. Each iteration
        was kicked off with a planning session and concluded with retrospective meetings, ensuring lessons were learned
        and applied for better results.</p>
      <h3>Deployment & Operations:</h3>
      <p>We built our deployment strategy around CI/CD principles, allowing for smooth and regular releases. Docker and
        Kubernetes were instrumental in containerization and orchestration, while AWS services, such as AWS Lambda and
        Amazon S3, further facilitated our operations.</p>
      <h3>Learnings & Future Scope:</h3>
      <p>This project underscored the transformative potential of a well-executed microservices architecture transition,
        especially during high-growth scaling phases. It also highlighted the critical importance of team coordination
        and clear communication. Moving forward, I aim to further leverage Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and other emerging
        technologies for system optimization.</p>
      <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
      <p>As a Staff Python Backend Developer, this project provided me with a unique opportunity to apply my technical
        and leadership skills during a critical transition phase. It was a testament to our team's ability to handle
        complex systems and ensure smooth operations during high-growth scaling. The success of this project stands as a
        testament to my ability to contribute meaningfully in such high-stakes environments.</p>

      <h2>A bit about me</h2>
      <p>I am a very curious and proactive professional with a great capacity to absorb new knowledge. I always seek
        to think creatively, practically, and systematically to achieve the most relevant results for the business. I
        always ask myself: What pain are we addressing here? How much value and differentiation will this add to the
        company? If the answer is positive, I try to understand which part of the whole will bring the greatest impact.
        Whether alone or in a group, it is a pleasure to accomplish and see things happen.</p>

      <p>As a neurodivergent person with Giftedness, my hyperfocus and commitment are focused on continuous learning and
        improvement, respecting both my uncommon abilities, such as divergent deep thinking, whole-detail perspective,
        integration of opposing ideas and perspectives, among others, and the limitations of my condition, such as
        hyperesthesia and hypersensitivities, among others.</p>

      <p>I thrive in projects that offer constant growth opportunities and challenges, particularly those with a
        data-driven, pragmatic, ethical, and pluralistic decision-making approach.</p>

        Other curiosities: once every 15 days, my friend Ana comes over and we do a home co-working session.

      <p>
        Also, once a month, Ana and I have a Spa Saturday, dedicated to being a day of relaxation, with meditation,
        QiGong
        and yoga practices, reiki, and more. It's important for us to reduce stress levels and keep our minds fresh and
        ready for action.
